# MNIST_project

The aim of this notebook is trying different methods to enable my computer to recognize different digits.

We will be working with the MNIST dataset. 

# Part 1 : statistical approach

First I will only be using the knowledges that I have learned in statistics.
I will try to approximate the probability of each pixel to be Black or White by using the Likelyhood function.

# Part 2 : an approach by neural networks

In this part I will build a simple neural networks from scratch

# Part 3: an approach by convolutional neural networks

Finally, we will see that the best method to recognize digits is using convolutional neural networks
